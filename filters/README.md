# Filters (Filters)

This folder contains implementations of simple digital and analog filters, focusing on embedded applications and basic simulations.

## Subfolders

- `lowpass_rc/`: Implements a low-pass RC (resistor-capacitor) filter in C++. Useful for sampling frequency.
- Other subfolders will contain high-pass filters, IIR/FIR digital filters and their simulations.

## Objective

To serve as a basis for study and practical tests to apply filters in embedded systems, sensors and simple signal processing.
